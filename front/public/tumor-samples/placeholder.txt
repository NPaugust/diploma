# Tumor Sample Images

This directory contains sample images for different tumor types.
In a real implementation, these would be actual MRI images from the dataset.

For now, the TumorImage component will show a placeholder with an icon.

To add real images:
1. Copy sample images from the dataset to this directory
2. Name them: normal.jpg, glioma.jpg, meningioma.jpg, etc.
3. The component will automatically load them
